      <ul>
        <li>In an age of rapid technological progress, trail maps have stayed stagnant
          since their inception</li>
        <li>The good old PDF version does its job but we believe the trail <map>
          could be greatly improved</li>

        <h3 class = "text-center"> Our Platform </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>SlopeScope is a web platform that takes the basic PDF version of a
            resort's trail map and turns it into a more informative and interactive
            image</li>
          <li>This eliminates the need to flip-flop back and forth between terrain
            status pages and PDF trail maps to find the best open runs</li>
      </div>
      <div class = "col-xs-4">
        <h3 class = "text-center">Other Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>SlopeScope also provides grooming information and everything else
            you would find on a terrain status pages
          <li>We also plan to add more useful information for each run, like average
            skier density</li>
